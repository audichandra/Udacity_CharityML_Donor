# Udacity_CharityML_Donor
The first Udacity Machine Learning Introduction nanodegree project which test my capability in applying supervised learning to the fictitious charity organization called CharityML in determing the likelihood of the donations made by donator candidates. After performing various transformations such as standardization and one-hot encoding as well as splitting the data, I set the metrics of the naive prediction as the evaluators for the three type of supervised learning: Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC). After finding out which learning is the most accurate, I perform tuning for the parameters in order to increase the accuracy of the prediction. I also extract the top five most important features (feature selection) and perform the learning again with only top five important features in order to increase the efficiency of the performing the learning.
